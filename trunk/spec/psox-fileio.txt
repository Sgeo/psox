Note that all paths use "/" regardless of whether it's on Windows or Linux

0x00 0x06 0x00 FNUM(1)/rwa FNUM(1)/updating FNUM(1)/binary STRINGNL/filename 0x0A
    Returns: FNUM(1)/success
    Opens a file
    rwa is 0x00 for mode r[eading]
           0x01 for mode w[riting]
           0x02 for mode a[ppending]
    updating puts a "+" after the mode if 0x01, and not if it's 0x00
    If binary is 0x00, the file will be opened in text mode, or binary mode otherwise
    
0x00 0x06 0x01 FNUM(1)/cd STRINGNL/dirname 0x0A
    Returns: FNUM(1)/success
    Makes directory dirname if it doesn't exist (if it does, it's harmless)
    If cd is not 0x00, changes current directory to that directory regardless of whether or not it existed beforehand
    success is 0x01 if there was no error (the directory existing does not count as an error), 0x00 otherwise
    
0x00 0x06 0x02 STRINGNL/entityname 0x0A
    Returns: FNUM(1)/exists
    Checks to see if entityname exists, and what type it is.
    If it is a file, returns 0x01
    If it is a directory, returns 0x02
    If it does not exist, returns 0x00
    
0x00 0x06 0x03 STRINGNL/entityname 0x0A
    Returns: FNUM(1)/read FNUM(1)/write FNUM(1)/execute
    Checks permissions on entityname
    If entityname does not exist, all permissions are returned as 0x00
    
0x00 0x06 0x04 0x0A
    Returns: STRING/path
    Returns the current working directory
    
0x00 0x06 0x05 FNUM(1)/all [STRINGNL/path] 0x0A
    Listing of [all] files and directories in path
    If path is ommitted, the current working directory is used.
    all indicates whether or not hidden files are included
    Each entry is in this form:
        TYPEINDICATOR name 0x0A
    where TYPEINDICATOR is 0x01 for files, 0x02 for directories
    The whole thing is terminated with a 0x00

0x00 0x06 0x06 FNUM(1)/recursive STRINGNL/entityname 0x0A
    Returns: FNUM(1)/success
    DELETES entityname
    recursive only applies to directories, it won't make a difference when deleting a file
