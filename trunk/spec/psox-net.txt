0x00 0x08 0x00 FNUM(1)/type FNUM(2)/port STRINGNL/addr 0x0A
    Returns: FNUM(1)/success
    Creates an FD that can be read from/written to.
    Type is 0x00 for TCP, 0x01 for UDP
    Port and addr should be obvious
    Returns 0x00 on error, 0x01 otherwise
    No FD is made on error
    
0x00 0x08 0x01 FNUM(1)/backlog FNUM(1)/type FNUM(2)/port STRINGNL/addr 0x0A
    Returns: FNUM(1)/success
    Makes a server socket. Server sockets start at 0x00 and are added at the lowest available number. Closing a server socket relinquishes that number and the other sockets stay at the same point. Backlog specifies how many connections can be queued up. Should be at least 1 and the maximum might be ~5. Addr may be blank(omitted) to bind to the localhost. Returns 0x00 if there was an error, 0x01 otherwise. If there is an error, no server socket is made.
    
0x00 0x08 0x02 FNUM(1)/blocking FNUM(1)/serversocket 0x0A
    Returns: FNUM(1)/ready STRING/addr
    If blocking is not 0x00, waits for a connection on serversocket, returning 0x01 and the addr of the connecting socket once there is a connection (if there is no error). If blocking is 0x00, checks to see if there is a connection waiting, and if there isn't, returns 0x00 and an empty STRING (0x00). Otherwise, returns 0x01 and the addr of the connecting socket.
    
0x00 0x08 0x03 FNUM(1)/fd 0x0A
    Returns: FNUM(1)/live
    Returns 0x01 if fd is a live socket, 0x00 if the socket is not live. Undefined if fd is not a socket
    
0x00 0x08 0x04 FNUM(1)/serversocket 0x0A
    Returns: Nothing
    Closes serversocket
    
0x00 0x08 0x05 STRINGNL/url 0x0A
    Returns: Nothing
    Creates an FD with the data returned from getting the URL
    
0x00 0x08 0x06 STRING/url STRINGNL/postdata 0x0A
    Returns: Nothing
    Creates an FD with the results of POSTing postdata to url. Remember that since url is a STRING, not a STRINGNL, it is NUL-terminated
