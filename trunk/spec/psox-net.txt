0x00 0x08 0x00 FNUM(1)/type FNUM(2)/port STRINGNL/addr 0x0A
    Returns: Nothing
    Creates an FD that can be read from/written to.
    Type is 0x00 for TCP, 0x01 for UDP
    Port and addr should be obvious
    
0x00 0x08 0x01 FNUM(1)/backlog FNUM(1)/type FNUM(2)/port STRINGNL/addr 0x0A
    Returns: Nothing
    Makes a server socket. Server sockets start at 0x00 and are added at the lowest available number. Closing a server socket relinquishes that number and the other sockets stay at the same point. Backlog specifies how many connections can be queued up. Should be at least 1 and the maximum might be ~5. Addr may be blank(omitted) to bind to the localhost.
    
0x00 0x08 0x02 FNUM(1)/serversocket 0x0A
    Returns: STRING/addr
    Accepts 1 connection on serversocket, making an FD, and returning the address of the connecting socket. (Remember that STRINGs are NUL-terminated)
    
0x00 0x08 0x03 FNUM(1)/serversocket 0x0A
    Returns: Nothing
    Closes serversocket
    
0x00 0x08 0x04 STRINGNL/url 0x0A
    Returns: Nothing
    Creates an FD with the data returned from getting the URL
    
0x00 0x08 0x05 STRING/url STRINGNL/postdata 0x0A
    Returns: Nothing
    Creates an FD with the results of POSTing postdata to url. Remember that since url is a STRING, not a STRINGNL, it is NUL-terminated
